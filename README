CTF Framework 0.1 README


1. Introduction
	Hello. You are about to use my ctf-framework. Here I'll try to publish all the information about ideas behind this system,
	about setting it up, about security etc. 

	Please check TODOLIST in this repository if you want to help us. Remember! In this framework tab identations are used! 
	Turn all your space identations into tabs before commiting. Thanks!

2. Ideas
	The main concept of this framework is to allow people import their tasks as easy as possible.
